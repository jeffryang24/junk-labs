A collection of junk scripts and crazy experiments. This lab structure is explained below.

- **Mantra**, a collection of tools which help bootstraping or configuring the system.
- **Legacy**, a collection of scripts or tools which will be deprecated in the near future.
- **My Memory**, a collection of scripts or tools which are not used inside system. (Not recommended to use this type, because old memory sometime is very hard to hold back :D)

New structure will be added in the near future.

# Warning

This repository contains unstable scripts which may cause damage to your system. I am not responsible for any error caused by the script. Please use the script wisely!

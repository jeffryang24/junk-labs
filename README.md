# Junks Lab

A collection of junk scripts and crazy experiments. This lab structure is explained below.

- **[Mantra]**, a collection of scripts and tools which help configuring or bootstrapping system.
- **[Drug]**, a collection of libraries which help bootstrapping the mantra.
- **[Legacy]**, a collection of libraries, scripts, and tools which will be deprecated in the near future.
- **My Memory**, a collection of libraries, scripts, and tools which are not used inside system. (Not recommended to use this type, because old memory sometime is very hard to hold back :D)

New structure will be added in the near future.
